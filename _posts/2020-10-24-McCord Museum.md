Not like other museums or galleries, McCORD Museum had been collecting objects, images, and documents related to Canada's history over three centuries including collections, document arts, dress, fashion and textiles, indigenous cultures, material culture, and so on.

The temporary exhibition about Christian Dior has driven a lot of interest, it examines Dior’s iconic lines, luxury textiles, and romantic embroideries that laid the foundation for the fashion house’s global success. Featuring breathtaking fashions from daytime to evening wear for grand occasions, the exhibition invites visitors to discover the exquisite craftsmanship, intricate detail, and inspired luxury designs by this key figure from the Golden Age of haute couture.


**Live virtual opening of the exhibition on September 23, 2020 hosted by Rebecca Makonnen.**
