# **Introduction**
Hello Nice to meet you!

I am LING JIN, you can call me Ling or **Genie** if you want. I am a Korean Chinese from Beijing, China, and I was major in International Politics (Diplomacy). During my internship, I have engaged in multiple areas such as website, design, and curation.

Museums or galleries which are full of different interactions or background stories would always attract me more than other museums, such as VR technologies or relevant videos. One of my favorite online exhibitions is [*the Palace Museum*](https://gugongzhanlan.dpm.org.cn/exhibitShare/111), which shows the whole exhibition online with 360 panoramic views.
