This weekâ€™s expedition to the British Museum website has been a great experience and I have received many great views toward this museum through our group reading.

Because of its historical issue, I always hold a mixed feeling towards the British Museum. It preserves a huge amount of collections that originally from other regions and countries such as Egypt and China through undignified actions. On the other hand, I also hold the view that a comprehensive museum should manage to gather remarkable collections from all over the world to show different cultures and their inherent meaning.

However, through the perspective of a digital gallery of arts, it did a perfect job to make their website clear, rich, and colorful. It carefully scanned their collections without damaging them and put great efforts to exhibit them in various means including 3D models and blog posts for people who could not visit the real museum from all over the world.

After all, it is a remarkable website with an exhibition and educational value.
