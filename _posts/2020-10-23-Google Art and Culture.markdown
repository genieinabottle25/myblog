**[Google Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/explore)**

Instead of a website, Google Arts & Culture is more like an online encyclopedia about arts and culture. We can find any artist, artwork, or even architecture while exploring this website and enjoy the high-resolution images and videos of these artworks.

Apart from admiring these artworks, this website implemented various technology tools to demonstrate the whole context of the artwork elaborately. Such as Google Street View 360-degree camera, VR, YouTube, and so on. All of this enables the public to virtually tour the galleries and admire the artworks they want. 

Another thing that impressed me is their use of metadata and their cooperation with Google Scholar, it helps the public to understand the artworks deeply, rather than merely admiring the pictures.
