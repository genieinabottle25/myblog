**[Internet Archieve](https://archive.org/)**

*The Internet Archive is an American digital library with the stated mission of "universal access to all knowledge." It provides free public access to collections of digitized materials, including websites, software applications/games, music, movies/videos, moving images, and millions of books. In addition to its archiving function, the Archive is an activist organization, advocating a free and open Internet. The Internet Archive currently holds over 20 million books and texts, 3 million movies and videos, 400,000 software programs, 7 million audio files, and 463 billion web pages in the Wayback Machine.
The Internet Archive allows the public to upload and download digital material to its data cluster, but the bulk of its data is collected automatically by its web crawlers, which work to preserve as much of the public web as possible. Its web archive, the Wayback Machine, contains hundreds of billions of web captures.The Archive also oversees one of the world's largest book digitization projects.(Wikipedia)*

As a website which aims at providing free resources, it must be simple and easy to search, while, in this website, I am mostly interested in their settings of metadata on their huge amount of collections. 

They chose Media Type, Year, Topics & Subjects, Collection, Creator, and Language as their metadata to make everyone can search for the content they want more easily. All of this makes this website a great resource center for people who look for ideas or raw materials like a designer or editor.
